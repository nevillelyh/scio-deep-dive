==============

Building Scio from scratch step by step.

`WordCount0.java` is the reference implementation using Apache Beam Java SDK.
Each subsequent `WordCount<n>.scala` is a self-contained incremental version that demonstrates some new concept.

See [NOTES.md](https://github.com/nevillelyh/scio-deep-dive/blob/master/NOTES.md) for further reading and exercises after each step.
